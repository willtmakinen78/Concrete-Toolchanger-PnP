## Concrete Toolchanger PnP
Some examples of what you can do with a Toolchanger and concrete extrusion.

Over the course of my master's degree, I built upon my thesis work with the Concrete Toolchanger via 2 term
projects. I explored the automatic embedment of RFID tags and other electronic modules into printed parts
in-situ to the print proces. This project served as a demonstration of '4D-printing' where smart materials
can be created by allowing them to sense and react to the environment around them. 

RFID tags were inserted into concrete prints to allow for quick, wireless detection of moisture content and
curing status. A specfic tag depositor tool for the toolchanger was developed to do this. To generalize the
concept, a pick-and-place tool was developed that allowed for the embedment of arbitrary items into prints.
